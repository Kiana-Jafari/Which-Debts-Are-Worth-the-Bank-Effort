Welcome! This notebook examines how different strategies used by a bank to recover debts work. It uses a statistical method to find out if the extra money spent on higher recovery efforts is worth it. The analysis involves looking at the data, using statistical models, and creating visuals to clearly show the financial impact of different recovery levels.

This notebook:
- Led data analysis on debt recovery strategies, enhancing the understanding of cost-benefit relationships
- Conducted regression discontinuity analysis, identifying key thresholds where additional recovery efforts are financially beneficial
- Developed detailed visualizations and statistical models to illustrate the impact of different recovery strategies on bank revenues
- Validated findings through comprehensive data examination, ensuring robust and actionable insights for improving bank recovery processes

Overall Insights: Incremental investments in recovery strategies (higher strategy levels) result in higher average recoveries, with the benefits outweighing the costs.

These insights can guide the bank in optimizing its recovery strategies by balancing the costs and expected recoveries to maximize net returns.
